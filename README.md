Team Name= Adaptix
🔍 Problem Statement:
Students and professionals often face difficulties finding the right partners for their projects, especially those with matching skill sets and aligned goals. Manually identifying ideal collaborators can be time-consuming and inefficient. To address this, an AI-powered platform can be developed to analyze profiles, preferences, and skill sets to recommend suitable project partners.

🎯 Objective:
The objective is to create a platform that uses AI/ML algorithms to:

Match individuals based on their skills, interests, and project requirements.

Recommend potential collaborators with a high probability of successful project outcomes.

Enhance team-building efficiency by suggesting the best matches based on compatibility.

🛠️ Tech Stack:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: Python, Django

Database: Firebase / MongoDB / MySQL (choose based on project requirement)

AI/ML Models:

Scikit-learn for profile matching and recommendation.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) for analyzing user preferences.

⚙️ Key Features:
✅ Profile Creation: Users can create detailed profiles highlighting their skills, interests, and project goals.
✅ AI-Powered Matching: Recommends compatible project partners using machine learning algorithms.
✅ Project Listing: Allows users to post project ideas and invite collaborators.
✅ Real-Time Chat: Facilitates smooth communication between potential partners.
✅ Notification System: Notifies users about new project opportunities and suitable matches.

🚀 How It Works:
User Registration: Create a profile with skills, preferences, and project goals.
